a = 10
b = 3

addition_result = a + b  # 13
subtraction_result = a - b  # 7
multiplication_result = a * b  # 30
division_result = a / b  # 3.3333333333333335
modulus_result = a % b  # 1
exponentiation_result = a ** b  # 1000
floor_division_result = a // b  # 3
Comparison Operators:
== (Equal): Checks if two operands are equal.
!= (Not Equal): Checks if two operands are not equal.
< (Less Than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
> (Greater Than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
<= (Less Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
>= (Greater Than or Equal To): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
Example:

python
Copy code
x = 5
y = 10

is_equal = x == y  # False
is_not_equal = x != y  # True
is_less_than = x < y  # True
is_greater_than = x > y  # False
is_less_than_or_equal = x <= y  # True
is_greater_than_or_equal = x >= y  # False
Logical Operators:
and: Returns True if both operands are True.
or: Returns True if at least one operand is True.
not: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.
Example:

python
Copy code
a = True
b = False

result_and = a and b  # False
result_or = a or b  # True
result_not = not a  # False
Assignment Operators:
= (Assignment): Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
+= (Add and Assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
-= (Subtract and Assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
*= (Multiply and Assign): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
/= (Divide and Assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Example:

python
Copy code
x = 5
y = 3

x += y  # Equivalent to x = x + y (x is now 8)
x -= y  # Equivalent to x = x - y (x is now 5)
x *= y  # Equivalent to x = x * y (x is now 15)
x /= y  # Equivalent to x = x / y (x is now 5.0)
These are some of the fundamental operator types in Python, and they play a crucial role in performing various operations on data in Python programs.
